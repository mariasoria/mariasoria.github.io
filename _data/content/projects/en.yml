        [Carlos Blé](https://www.carlosble.com) and I participated in this conference with a talk where we dressed up,
        explained the importance of writing sustainable code and apply good practises and we give some advise of how
        to do it and not die while trying.
        The recorded session is not public, but [here](https://leanmind.es/es/blog/codigo-sostenible-song/) you can see
        a bit of what it was and learn the song of the sustainable code.

        Airán and Isaac did me the honor of inviting me to their newly released podcast, being their second guest.

        going to talk about technical things but we ended up talking about the wonders that One Plus devices hide
        and telling some other anecdotes, to say the least, embarrassing...
