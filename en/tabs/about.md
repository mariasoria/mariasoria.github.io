My name is Maria and I was born in Valencia (Spain).

I decided to study a degree in Engineering in Telematics inspired by my brother who was studying computering.

During my professional life I have worked with different programming languages such Java,
Perl, Javascript or Python and used different frameworks like Spring Boot, Vue3 and Django.
I have worked with docker and different kind of databases both relational and document-oriented as well.

I share a [Twitch](https://www.twitch.com/codingiscaring) channel with my friend [Yodra](https://www.yodralopez.dev) where we talk about coding, such as design patterns,
katas, good practises and so on.

I'm a member of the women developer's association [AdaLoveDev](https://www.twitter.com/adalovedev)
and co-organiser of the event [AdaLoversConf](http://adaloversconf.es).
