##### Requirements:

- Node y npm
- IDE, for example: Visual Studio Code

##### Installing node+npm:

1. Download node:
   - From [https://nodejs.org/es/](https://nodejs.org/en/)
   - Select the button to download the version LTS (the recommended for  most of the users).
2. Install Node with double-click in the file you have just downloaded.

With this installation you will get node and npm (which is a package manager for Node Javascript Platform).

If you want to check the versions you have installed, you can type in the terminal:

`node -v`

or

`npm -v`

##### Creating a new project:

Go to the terminal and navigate until the folder where you want to create your project in and type:

`npx gitignore node`

This will download the relevant gitignore file from github with the configuration in it. Then type:

`npm init -y`

And your project will be created with all the attributes by default. If you want to customize those attributes when creating the project you can type instead:

`npm init`

##### Installing dependencies (jest, in this case):

In the terminal type:

`npm install --save-dev jest`

Automatically, this dependency will be installed and add it to your *package.json* which contains the configuration of the project.

Now you can start building and testing your project.

##### Structure of the project

This is the structure of my project:

![Project Root](:/node_jest/raizproyecto.png)

- `__test__` : folder which contains my files for testing
- `src` : folder which contains my code

##### Testing my first file

I create the file ***sum.js*** in ***src*** and add the next code:

```js
exports.sum = (a, b) => a + b;
```

I create the file ***sum.test.js*** for testing in ***__ test__*** with the next code:

```jsx
const {sum} = require('../src/sum');

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

And I run the test from the terminal with:

`npm run test`

I get the next result which says that all the tests passed:

![Test results](:/node_jest/testresults.png)

Now, you can continue doing more tests.

Below you can find more information about starting testing with jest:
